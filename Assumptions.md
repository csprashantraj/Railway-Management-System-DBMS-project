# Assumptions

1. **Station Types and Codes**
   - Each station has a unique numeric `station_id`.
   - Station types are categorized simply as 'junction' or 'central'.
   - Station names are unique and descriptive (e.g., 'secundrabad', 'New Delhi').

2. **Train Information**
   - Each train has a unique numeric `train_no`.
   - `train_name` is descriptive and unique for identification.
   - Start and end times are stored as timestamps for precise scheduling.
   - Start and end stations are linked via station codes.

3. **Route Details**
   - Each route is identified by a unique combination of `route_id` and `sequence_no`.
   - Routes include arrival and departure times as timestamps.
   - Distances from origin are measured and stored numerically.

4. **Class Information**
   - Train classes (e.g., '2AC', '3AC', 'S', 'G') are defined by a unique `class_id`.
   - Each train has multiple classes with a defined number of seats per coach.

5. **Fare Structure**
   - Fares are calculated based on fixed charges and distance charges for each class.
   - Fares are linked to specific train and class combinations.

6. **Coach Information**
   - Each coach is uniquely identified by a combination of `coach_no`, `train_no`, and `class_id`.
   - Coaches are categorized by class type and linked to specific trains.

7. **User and Ticket Management**
   - Users are identified by a unique username and have associated login details.
   - Each ticket has a unique PNR and includes travel details such as date, boarding, and destination stations.
   - Tickets are linked to specific trains and user accounts.

8. **Payment and Passenger Details**
   - Payments are tracked with a unique `payment_id` and associated with specific PNRs.
   - Payment methods include options like 'UPI' and 'NetBanking'.
   - Passengers are linked to tickets by PNR and have details like name, age, gender, and status.

9. **Waiting List and Seat Booking**
   - Waiting list entries are managed with a unique `waiting_no` per PNR.
   - Seats booked are tracked by train, seat number, passenger name, PNR, and coach number.

10. **Database Constraints and Relationships**
    - Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity between tables.
    - Primary keys uniquely identify records within each table.
    - Timestamp fields ensure accurate tracking of schedules and events.

These assumptions guide the design and implementation of the Railway Management System Database, ensuring a structured and comprehensive approach to managing railway operations and data.
